### 100 Days Of Design

100 days of design is an idea gotten from `#100DaysOfCode`  where an individual write code `everyday`  for `100 days`.

On the quest to improve my illustrator design skills, I decide to take the same approach and implement a __100 Days Of Design__ .

Hope you like it 😃

## THE DESIGNS

Myself - I did an illustration of myself-ish 😜 to get the challenge started
